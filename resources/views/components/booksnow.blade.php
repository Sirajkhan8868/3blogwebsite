                I had my part 2 training last Saturday and I was so happy with the outcome. Yasmine was so amazing with the way she guided and supported me during the training.  Her techniques of training and beliefs in me really did make me want to impress her even more. I am so happy that I made the best decision to choose Inspire London college to do my phlebotomy course, thank you very much for everything.Also, I just wanted to ask if you can let me know or put me on the list for work experience with Yasmine if it comes available, I really need it to improve my skills and I am very determined to found a job after all this..I have also done my health and safety test if you can please send me the certificate. Once more thank you very much for everything.

                Thanks for the Fantastic course. Your trainers are not only knowledgeable, but they go beyond and above the expectations. They make sure that you have an understanding of all the content, a mock quiz to check on understanding and knowledge is a plus point and up to date resources. I am extremely happy and will recommend this course to others. Thank you
